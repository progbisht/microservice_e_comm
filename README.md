# E-commerce Microservices with Test Driven Development
This e-commerce project is built on the microservice architecture and follows the test-driven development approach. In this project, there are two services the product and the order service. The project service is responsible for handling the product catalog and the order service is responsible for managing the cart and order service. The product catalog service is implemented following the object-oriented programming paradigm and the order service follows the functional programming paradigm. The services are developed following the clean architecture principles i.e., independent of language and frameworks, UI and database, and are testable. The services are responsible for communicating and notifying each other if they encounter any change in the state of their database.


## Objective
- To understand the microservice architecture and implement the same in a real-world project.
- To understand and implement the test-driven development approach.
- To have an overview and understanding of Domain Driven Development and Clean Architecture.
- To understand the synchronous and asynchronous communication between the services.
